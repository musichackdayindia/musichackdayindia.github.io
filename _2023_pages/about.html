      <p>Music Hack Day India is a community-driven event where we would like programmers, artists, makers, academics and innovators to come together to ideate, develop and demo their vision of 
        music technologyâ€™s future. No restrictions in terms of the medium of the hack - software (mobile, web, desktop), hardware (new instruments, modifications to existing ones). We are open to anything 
        that lies within the boundaries of music technology (even better if the boundaries are extrapolated). One of our bigger goals of organizing such an event is to bring everyone working or interested in this field under one roof so that they can network and collaborate with each other by the means of working on these hacks and further push music tech scene in the Indian sub-continent.</p>
      <p>Music Hack Day India is an open, inclusive and interdisciplinary event. We follow the <a href="https://berlincodeofconduct.org/">Berlin Code of Conduct </a> for the event.</p>
