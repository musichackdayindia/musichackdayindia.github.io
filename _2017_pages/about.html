      <p>Music Hack Day India is a community driven event where we would like programmers, artists, makers, academics and innovators to come together to ideate, develop and demo their vision of 
        music technology’s future. No restrictions in terms of the medium of hack - software(mobile, web, desktop), hardware(new instruments, modifications to existing ones). We are open to anything 
        that lies within the boundaries of music technology(even better if the boundaries are extrapolated). One of our bigger goals of organizing such an event is to bring everyone working or interested 
        in working in this field under one roof so that they can network and collaborate with each other by the means of working on these hacks and further push music tech scene in the Indian sub-continent.</p>
      <p>Music Hack Day India is an open, inclusive and interdiscplinary event. We follow <a href="https://berlincodeofconduct.org/">Berlin Code of Conduct </a> for the event.</p>

      <h2 class="first">Algorave Concerts</h2>

      <p>An algorave (from an algorithm and rave) is an event where people dance to music generated from algorithms, often using live coding techniques. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorave" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>)</p>
      <p>We are very glad to have our friends from the growing Algorave India community to perform. The following artists will perform a live set on 14th Saturday, December evening</p>
